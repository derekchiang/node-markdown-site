##### ![](/images/me.jpg)

My name is Derek Chiang (姜恩池 in Chinese).

I'm a hacker, software engineer, computer scientist, whatever you call it.  My laptop is an extension of my body; Internet that of my mind.

I'm currently a sophomore at Cornell studying computer science (surprise!!).  Among all the areas of CS I've explored, distributed systems and programming languages interest me the most.  Other than computer science, I also like astronomy and literature a lot.

While I can code in a variety of programming languages, JavaScript, Python, and Clojure are my go-tos.  I try to be as much of a generalist as possible, but most of my personal projects are related to the web.

When I'm not coding, you will most likely find me playing basketball, [table tennis](http://cornell-pingpong-ranking.herokuapp.com/), or Counter Strike.  Definitely contact me if you want to play Counter Strike together by the way.

Duplications are bad, so please refer to [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/derekchiang93) for my résumé and [Github](https://github.com/derekchiang) for my (public) projects.
